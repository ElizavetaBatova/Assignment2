As you can see I apploaded all the files from the folder of environment except library here. 
The key files are 'assignment2.py', (folder 'templates') 'home.html', 'preferences.html', 'recipe_input', 'recipe_plan' and (folder 'static') 'style.css'.
I also sent some screenshots in canvas, in case the organization of files wasn't clear.
